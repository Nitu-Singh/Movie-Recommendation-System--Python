# Movie-Recommendation-System--Python
I have developed a basic movie recommendation system based on content based filtering usinf Python and pandas.
This is not a very robust recommender, it will give the list of movies which are similar to the movie you choose.
There are 2 files, U-data( file with user_id, movie_id and movie_ratings) and Movie_list( movie_id and movie_title).
